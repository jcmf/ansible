There.  There it is.  Phew.

Can you hear me?  [[Yes->cards]] or [[no->can't hear]].

# can't hear

Well that's not good.  Maybe if I adjust the... hold on....

#cards

Okay, listen carefully, this is important.  I'm drawing a card
now... okay.  It's face down, I haven't looked at it.  Can you tell
me what card it is?  It's okay if you can't.  [[Yes->card yes]], or
[[no->card no]].

#card no

Thank you for being honest.  It's... the sixteen of trumps.  Once
again, the sixteen of trumps.  Now we both have to try again, I
guess.  Thanks, good luck....

#{@end()}

#card yes

Okay, uh... let's do, like, suits?  Is it, um, [[clubs]], or
[[spades]], or [[hearts]], or [[diamonds]], or [[trumps]].  And
before you ask, the joker is a trump.  Or pretend it is.  You know
what I mean.

#clubs

Hold on, I'm writing this down.  Clubs.  Um.  Is it a face card?
Uh, [[yes->face]] or [[no->low]].

#spades

Hold on, I'm going to write this down.  Spades?  Spades.  Okay.  Is
it a face card?  [[Yes->face]], or [[no->low]].

#hearts

Hold on, I'm writing it down.  Hearts.  Got it.  Uh... is it a face
card?  [[Yes->face]] or [[no->low]].

#diamonds

Hold on, I'm... diamonds.  It was diamonds.  I wrote it down.  Okay.
Is it a face card?  [[Yes->face]], or [[no->low]].

#face

[[Jack->wrong1]], [[Knight->wrong2]], [[Queen->wrong3]], [[King->wrong4]]?

#low

[[One->wrong4]] [[two->wrong3]] [[three->wrong2]] [[four->wrong1]]
[[five->wrong3]] [[six->wrong2]] [[seven->wrong4]] [[eight->wrong1]]
[[niiiiine->wrong2]]... [[ten->wrong3]]?

#wrong1

Okay!  I am going to look, and, it's the sixteen of trumps.  Yep.
Once again, it's the sixteen of trumps.  Sorry about that.  I have
to try again.  You can try again too maybe.  Thank you, buhbye.

#{@end()}

#wrong2

Okay!  I am going to look now, and, it's the sixteen of trumps.
Yep.  Once again, it's the sixteen of trumps.  Sorry about that.
I have to try again.  You can try again too maybe.  Thank you,
bye.

#{@end()}

#wrong3

Okay!  I am going to look, and... it's the sixteen.  Of trumps.  Yep.
Once again, it's the sixteen of trumps.  Sorry about that.  I have to
try again, and you should try again too.  Thank you!  G'bye!

#{@end()}

#wrong4

Okay.  I am going to look... and it's the sixteen of trumps.  Yep.
Once again, it's the sixteen of trumps.  I'm sorry.  I have to try
again now.  Thank you.  Oh, you should try again too.  Okay, bye.

#{@end()}

#trumps

Hold on, I'm just going to write this... trumps, okay.  Is it a...
uh, sorry... [[one through ten->low]], [[eleven through twenty-one->high]],
or the, the [[joker]].

#joker

It is really the joker?  Oh never mind I just looked and it's not...
it's the sixteen of trumps.  Uh.  Once again, the sixteen of trumps.
Please make a note of it.  I have to try this again now.  Thank
you!  Oh, you should try again too, if you can.  Uh, bye.

[[twenty->wrong4]], [[twenty-one->wrong1]].  Or the... no, we covered
that, sorry, never mind, sorry!  Long day.  Okay.  Go.

#correct

Okay!  I am going to look, and, it's... wow, pretty good.  Pretty
good.  You got it.  Sixteen.  I guess that means we're good to go!
Are you ready?  Say [[yes]].

#yes

Okay.  Let me just get ready.  I'll be right back.

#{@pause 925}

Sorry that took so long!  I got hungry.  Are you still there?  Say
[[yes->there]].

#there

Okay!  Time to do your job.  What do we go for now?  [[Water->water]],
or [[ring]]?

#water

Right to the point!  I like it.  So, okay, I kinda have a plan already...
should I just [[get started]] with that?  Or is it [[no good]]?

# get started

Perfect.  I'll check back in a bit!

#{@end()}

# no good

Huh, okay.  Well, what do you suggest, then?  Stay [[here]]?  Can
I at least go as far as the [[crossroads]]?

#crossroads

Sounds good!  I'll see you in a bit.

#{@pause 5424}

Hey, are you... wow, you're totally there, I can tell.  Reception
must be good out here or something.  Oh my god, this is trippy.
Sorry, okay.  I'm at the crossroads!  So, uh... [[north]], [[south]],
[[east]], or [[west]]?

#north

Really.  You want me to go back north.  Is there... what the hell.
Should I just go back [[home]], then?  Or did you want me to [[stop]]
along the way?

#home

Okay, fine.  I mean I totally trust you and everything, it's just,
I hope you had a good reason... you're sure you're not messing with
me?  [[Yes->messing]] or [[no->not messing]].

# not messing

All right!  Home it is.  I'm gonna turn this thing off again, it's
really, uh, strong.  Talk to you soon.

#{@end()}

# messing

Seriously?  You think this is... oh my god, my teeth are, like,
vibrating.  I gotta turn this off.  Just... [[north->n2]],
[[south->s2]], [[east->e2]], or [[west->w2]]?

# n2

I can't believe I... we'll talk about this later, okay?

#{@end()}

# w2

Right on.  Wait, is it right?  It's totally right.  Right!  I'll
check back later.

#{@end()}

# e2

Right... no, left.  Yes!  Left.  Good.  I'll check back in a bit.

#{@end()}

# s2

South.  Which would be... just, yeah, okay.  I'll talk to you later.

#{@end()}

#stop

Like, anywhere in particular?  Or just... this thing where you're
in my head is driving me crazy, my teeth are like... how about if
I check back in half an hour?  Or if anything interesting happens.
Great, catch you later.  Oh my god.  They're, like, singing.

#{@end()}

#south

Sounds good!  I'll check back in a bit.

#{@end()}

#east

So... hold on... that way.  Got it.  I'll talk to you in a bit.
Wow, this thing is, I don't know, powerful.  Feels weird.

#{@end()}

#west

So... uh... wow, this thing is really getting to me, can't think
straight.  No, I got it, this way.  Yes.  Good.  Talk to you in a bit.

#{@end()}

#ring

Yeah, right on, collect the whole set.  You're not going to get
jealous, are you?  Sorry, maybe that's... anyway I'm getting ahead
of myself.  I don't even know where to start... okay, let me think.
I mean there's the castle, obviously.  Even if it isn't there...
wait, I forgot to... okay, okay, let's do this: Castle!  [[Yes->castle]]
castle, or [[no->no castle]] castle?

# no castle

Not the castle.  Is it... agh... it doesn't even matter where it
is, I just need to, like, make progress somehow, right?  Look, we're
in the middle of nowhere here, right?  I could head down the [[road]],
I could... uh... [[not]] head down the road?

# road

Okay, great, let's do this.  I'll check back in a bit.

#{@pause 5390}

Hey, I'm... wow, it's like you're really... wow.  This is intense.
Okay.  I'm at the crossroads!  I could turn [[left]], I could go
[[right]], I could just keep going [[straight]].  You tell me.

#left

Left it is!  Wow.  Okay, talk to you soon.

#{@end()}

#right

Right you are!  Heh heh... whoa, okay, I'll talk to you soon.

#{@end()}

#straight

Got it.  Yeah, I'm just going to, I'll talk to you soon.

#{@end()}

#here

Ugh.  Hold on, I need to eat something.  I'll be right back.

#{@end()}

#castle

Castle it is!  I'll check back in when I get close.

#{@end()}

#not

So you just want me to stay here?  [[Yes->stay]] or [[no->go]]?

#stay

Fine.  Let me... I'm still kind of hungry actually.  I'll be back
in a minute.

#{@end()}

#go

Okay, I guess I'll just go wander aimlessly through the forest,
then!

#{@pause 722}

Hey!  I think I see something.  There's a light.  Campfire, maybe.
I'm going to go [[check it out]], unless you think that's a [[bad
idea]].

# bad idea

Gosh, you're no fun.  All right, I'll let you know if I come across
anything else.

#{@pause 4232}

A presence!  Not alone.  Not alone.  Hope!

Help me!

Disaster!  Stupid, stupid disaster.

Can we communicate?

No change.

This protuberance could be a winding mechanism.  Perhaps

#{@end()}

# check it out

Okay, let me see if I can get closer.

#{@pause 240}

Tall people arguing!  Two at least.  I can't quite hear what they're
saying.  Wow, they seem... agitated.  Hmm.  Maybe I should get
[[closer]]?  Or [[no->not closer]]?

# not closer

All right.

Hold on, I want to see if I can hear if I take this off.

#{@end()}

# closer

"...not what we agreed."

Okay, I

"Listen!  Just listen!"

"Like you listened to me?  I don't have to --"

"Listen!"

wow,

"I don't have to!  It's mine!  It's mine by right!  He told us --"

"No, listen!  There!  Did you hear it?"

Crap.  Crap crap crap.

Maybe I could still... I could [[pretend]] I was just... or just
[[lay low]]....

# lay low

"Who's there?"

"We know you're out there!"

"You cannot deceive us!"

"Yeah, we're not gonna take it anymore!"

"Oh, be quiet."

"You be quiet!"

"This is serious!  Pipe down for once!"

"Make me!"

"Don't tempt me."

"You wouldn't."

"Two birds...."

"Drop it!"

"All heads off."

"Don't do this!"

"Mine alone remain!"

#{@end()}

"Who's there?"

"Oh!  It's just, it's just, uh," crap, "oh!  Me.  Heh heh.  I was
just, uh, taking a walk, and," crap.  Crap!  "And I saw your, uh,
campfire!"

Actually, that's not --

"Who are you?"

"Oh!  I'm," do I, [[what]] --

# what

Crap!

"Valeria.  I'm Valeria!  Pleased to meet you?"

Hey, this could --

"Greetings, Valeria!  My name is Nara, and my sister's name is Uda.
Please forgive our impoliteness; we can be very, ah, stupid, at
times."

"Oh!  Are you giants?"

Ohmygod, did I just, oh my god, what the crap am I, they're gonna --

"How very perspicacious of you.  Truly -- ah, in fact, my sluggish giant
brain is beginning to develop a thought."

"Uh?"

"Yes!  An idea."

What the hell?

"Why don't you join us by the fire, that we may converse more freely?"

Um.  Um!  [[Do it?]]  [[No?]]

# No?

Seriously, right?

"Yeah, uh... thank you for the kind offer but I really can't stay,
I have to, um.  I should be going."

"But you must help us!  We are so stupid!"

"Stop calling me stupid!"

"Gnot gnow, shishter!"

Yow.

"Okay well it was very nice meeting you, take care!"

Oh my goodness.

Oh my goodness.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Wow.

[[Wow.]]

# Wow.

Whoops!  Still getting the hang of this.

That was exciting, right?  What the hell.  Right?

Hold

#{@end()}

# Do it?

"Uhhhhhh... suuuuuure... just, uh, yeah, here we go, right, whoops,
ha, okay, yes, okay, here we are, here we go."

"Please, make yourself comfortable!  There is no need to stand!  I
can offer you this, ah, this fine flat rock!"

"Oh!  I wouldn't want to, uh...."

"Sit."

Yikes.

"You are undoubtedly eager for me to present my idea.  I shall now elucidate!"

"Okay."

"My sister and I are the recent recipients of an inheritence.  Being
quite, ah, stupid, we are unable to divide it amicably."

"So... someone died?"

"No one of consequence.  A distant relative."

"And you want me to decide who gets what?"

"That is correct.  Now, your first thought will be to --"

"Is that one of the things?"

"Ah, yes, the sword.  Perhaps, however, it would be better to --"

"What else?"

"A most excellent question!  In addition to the aforementioned
sword, we have inherited this fine mantle."

Huh!

"And these stylish boots."

Ooh!

"Don't you listen to her lies!  They're dangerous!  Cursed!"

Oho?

"My sister's fears are groundless.  It is true, however, that these
items have useful magical properties."

Hey, don't I have... ha ha, almost forgot... so should I, uh,
[[listen]] or... no, just --

# listen

"What do they do?"

"Horrible things!"

"Shush!  You see how uncivilized we are.  As I was explaining, the
mantle confers perfect invisibility, while the boots will instantaneously
transport the wearer to an arbitrary location."

Sounds pretty fancy!  "And the sword?"

"The sword is, ah, preternaturally sharp."

"I, uh, got it."  Gosh.  Okay.  Well.  I could... ask more
[[questions]], I could [[suggest]] something, I could... um... try
to think of something [[else]]....

# questions

"So... uh... you want me to tell you who should get which thing?"

"How very astute of you!  Why, that is the very purpose which we
had envisioned when we brought you here!"

"Speak for yourself!"

"Ah, see how hopeless it would be to expect us to resolve this difficulty
without your assistance!  Truly, you are our only hope!"

Well.

"Can I try them?"

"No!"

"Ah, let us not be too hasty, sister!  After all, how is Valeria
to gauge the value of these items, if not by verifying their
properties for herself?"

Gosh.  [[Boots->boots]], [[mantle]], or [[sword]]?

# boots

"Then I would like to try the boots, please."

"Certainly!  Only you must promise to bring them back, of course.
In fact it might be best if you were to leave behind some sort of
guarantee, some... do you have anything of value?"

"Well... uh... I mean... I do have this ring...."

Crap!  Maybe --

"Ah!  May I examine it?"

Agh, what now?  [[Yes->yes examine]], or [[no->no examine]]?

# yes examine

"Um... sure?  I, uh... it's a magic ring."

"Really!  How very appropriate.  What properties does it have?"

"It, uh... sometimes you can ask it a question... I mean it takes
some practice, you can't just... I mean you can, you can try it,
but... I just, I spent a lot of time earlier adjusting it, so don't
--"

#{@pause 20}

A presence!  Remarkable.  Have I underestimated her?  I think not.  She
believes it, certainly.  And if she is correct, so much the better.

"My, such a powerful aura!  Truly impressive!"

The boots now?  Yes.  The boots.  She'll be back.

"I, uh... I just... do I... how do I...?"

"Don't!"

"Quiet, you.  Just make a wish.  But don't forget to wish yourself
back here!"

"I wish, uh... I wish I was home!"

Odd!  Are they fitted improperly?  Did she....

Oh no.

"Told you."

Horrifying.

Look away.  No, don't.

Incredible.

Gone!

"This is what you saw?"

"Pretty much."

"But don't you see?  This is, ah, undoubtedly merely a side effect of the
artifact's intended principle of operation!  Subjectively instantaneous,
but not physically, ah --"

"I'm back!  Wow, these are pretty good!"

"Ah!  Yes.  Yes, you certainly are.  Back."

"We should totally trade!  I mean, I would, uh...."

"We'll have plenty of time to discuss that, I'm certain, but for
now if I might assist you with, ah, there, if you would --"

#{@end()}

# no examine

"I... uh... I'd rather that you didn't, actually."

"Ah, fair enough, fair enough!  Then, ah, perhaps you would feel
more at ease entrusting your valued heirloom to Uda, here?  Merely
for safekeeping, you understand.  While you essay the boots."

"Me?"

Huh.  [[Yes->yes uda]], [[no->no uda]]?

# yes uda

"Okay, just, uh... be careful of this part, it's very, um, delicate,
so try not to brush it or, like, twist it, or anything.  Also, if
you, um...."

"I know."

"You do?  You do.  Okay."

Okay.  Be cool.

#{@pause 4}

Hello.  We met!  Not you, I s'pose.  Another of you.  Please help!
I'm too...

"There we go!  Now, ah --"

Oh no.  {{Fight}}.  {{Speak}}.  {{Wait}}.  Go.

# no uda

"Yeah, uh, no, I don't think... maybe you could just show me?"

"Demonstrate the operation of these artifacts, you mean?"

Crap.  {{Yes->yes demo}}?  {{No->no demo}}?

# mantle

"Then I would like to try the... mantle?"

"Certainly!  Only you must promise to return it!  Naturally you
would never dream of doing otherwise, however it might be best if
you were to leave behind some sort of guarantee, some... do you
have anything of value?"

"Well, um... there's this ring...."

Crap!  Maybe I --

"Ah!  May I examine it?"

Hey, what do I say?  [[Yes->yes x (mantle)]], or [[no->no x (mantle)]]?

# sword

"Then I would like to, um, check out the sword?"

"Certainly!  Only you must be careful with it.  I would advise against
touching the blade at all, for example."

"Okay."

"I don't like this!"

"You really must control these unseemly outbursts, sister!  Valeria
intends only to assist us!  We have nothing to fear from her.  Go on,
Valeria."

"Oh, wow!  It's so... light?  Not light, but...."

"Perhaps you would like to test it on one of those boulders?  Carefully,
of course."

"Seriously?  I can just... oh my god.  This is amazing.  Hey, what's
with this inscription?"

"Ah --"

"Stop!"

"All heads off, mine alone remain.  Crap, it...."

Holy crap.

Both of them.

Where is it now?  Oh god.

This is bad.

"Why don't you flip a coin?"

"I, ah, I beg your pardon?"

"Like, for each thing.  Heads you get it, tails she gets it.  Easy."

"No!  You can't, you can't let her..."

"I believe what my sister is attempting to articulate is that, as,
ah, brilliant though this plan may be in its simplicity, it nonetheless
poses a significant risk of a decidedly unfair outcome, specifically,
that the totality of the items in question might go to --"
