Crap!

"Valeria.  I'm Valeria!  Pleased to meet you?"

Hey, this could --

"Greetings, Valeria!  My name is Nara, and my sister's name is Uda.
Please forgive our impoliteness; we can be very, ah, stupid, at
times."

"Oh!  Are you giants?"

Ohmygod, did I just, oh my god, what the crap am I, they're gonna --

"How very perspicacious of you.  Truly -- ah, in fact, my sluggish giant

Um.  Um!  [[Do it?]]  [[No?]]

"Oh!  I wouldn't want to, uh...."

"Sit."

Yikes.

"You are undoubtedly eager for me to present my idea.  I shall now elucidate!"

"Okay."

"My sister and I are the recent recipients of an inheritance.  Being
quite, ah, stupid, we are unable to divide it amicably."

"So... someone died?"

"No one of consequence.  A distant relative."

"And you want me to decide who gets what?"

"That is correct.  Now, your first thought will be to --"

"Is that one of the things?"

"Ah, yes, the sword.  Perhaps, however, it would be better to --"

"What else?"

"A most excellent question!  In addition to the aforementioned
sword, we have inherited this fine mantle."

Huh!

"And these stylish boots."

Ooh!

"Lies!  Don't listen!  Dangerous!  Cursed!"

Oho?

"My sister's fears are groundless.  It is true, however, that these
items have useful magical properties."

Hey, don't I have... ha ha, almost forgot... so should I, uh,
[[listen]] or... no, just --

# listen

"What do they do?"

"Horrible things!"

"Shush!  You see how uncivilized we are.  As I was explaining, the
mantle confers perfect invisibility, while the boots will instantaneously
transport the wearer to an arbitrary location."

Sounds pretty fancy!  "And the sword?"

"The sword is, ah, preternaturally sharp."

"I, uh, got it."  Gosh.  Okay.  Well.  I could... ask more
[[questions]], I could [[suggest]] something, I could... um....

# questions

"So... uh... you want me to tell you who should get which thing?"

"How very astute of you!  Why, that is the very purpose which we
had envisioned when we brought you here!"

"Liar!"

"Ah, see how hopeless it would be to expect us to resolve this difficulty
without your assistance!  Truly, you are our only hope!"

Well.

"Can I try them?"

"No!"

"Ah, let us not be too hasty, sister!  After all, how is Valeria
to gauge the value of these items, if not by verifying their
properties for herself?"

Gosh.  [[Boots->boots]], [[mantle]], or [[sword]]?

# boots

"Then I would like to try the boots, please."

"Certainly!  Only you must promise to bring them back, of course.
In fact it might be best if you were to leave behind some sort of
guarantee, some... do you have anything of value?"

"Well... uh... I mean... I do have this ring...."

Crap!  Maybe --

"Ah!  May I examine it?"

Agh, what now?  [[Yes->yes examine]], or [[no->no examine]]?

# yes examine

"Um... sure?  I, uh... it's a magic ring."

"Really!  How very appropriate.  What properties does it have?"

"It, uh... there's, like, an angel, and sometimes you can ask it a
question... I mean it takes some practice, you can't just... I mean
you can, you can try it, but... I just, I spent a lot of time finding
a good one, so don't mess --"

"I, uh... I just... do I... how do I...?"

"Don't!"

"Quiet, you.  Just make a wish.  But don't forget to wish yourself
back here!"

"I wish, uh... I wish I was home!"

Odd!  Are they fitted improperly?  Did she....

Oh no.

"Told you."

Horrifying.

Look away.  No, don't.

Incredible.

Gone!

"This is what you saw?"

"Pretty much."

"But don't you see?  This is, ah, undoubtedly merely a side effect of the
artifact's intended principle of operation!  Subjectively instantaneous,
but not physically, ah --"

"I'm back!  Wow, these are pretty good!"

"Ah!  Yes.  Yes, you certainly are.  Back."
