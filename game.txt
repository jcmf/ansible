#cards

Okay, listen carefully, this is important.  I'm drawing a card
now... okay.  It's face down, I haven't looked at it.  Can you tell
me what card it is?  It's okay if you can't.  [[Yes->card yes]], or
[[no->card no]].

#card no

Thank you for being honest.  It's... the sixteen of trumps.  Once
again, the sixteen of trumps.  Now we both have to try again, I
guess.  Thanks, good luck....

@@@ CONNECTION LOST

#card yes

Okay, uh... let's do, like, suits?  Is it, um, [[clubs]], or
[[spades]], or [[hearts]], or [[diamonds]], or [[trumps]].  And
before you ask, the joker is a trump.  Or pretend it is.  You know
what I mean.

#correct

Okay!  I am going to look, and, it's... wow, pretty good.  Pretty
good.  You got it.  Sixteen.  I guess that means we're good to go!
Are you ready?  Say [[yes]].

#yes

Okay.  Let me just get ready.  I'll be right back.

@@@ CONNECTION SUSPENDED/RESUMED; ELAPSED TIME 925s

Sorry that took so long!  I got hungry.  Are you still there?  Say
[[yes->there]].

#there

Okay!  Time to do your job.  What do we go for now?  [[Water->water]],
or [[ring]]?

#water

Right to the point!  I like it.  So, okay, I kinda have a plan already...
should I just [[get started]] with that?  Or is it [[no good]]?

# get started

Perfect.  I'll check back in a bit!

@@@ CONNECTION LOST

# no good

Huh, okay.  Well, what do you suggest, then?  Stay [[here]]?  Can
I at least go as far as the [[crossroads]]?

#crossroads

Sounds good!  I'll see you in a bit.

@@@ CONNECTION SUSPENDED/RESUMED; ELAPSED TIME 5424s

Hey, are you... wow, you're totally there, I can tell.  Reception
must be good out here or something.  Oh my god, this is trippy.
Sorry, okay.  I'm at the crossroads!  So, uh... [[north]], [[south]],
[[east]], or [[west]]?

#north

Really.  You want me to go back north.  Is there... what the hell.
Should I just go back [[home]], then?  Or did you want me to [[stop]]
along the way?

#home

Okay, fine.  I mean I totally trust you and everything, it's just,
I hope you had a good reason... you're sure you're not messing with
me?  [[Yes->messing]] or [[no->not messing]].

# not messing

All right!  Home it is.  I'm gonna turn this thing off again, it's
really, uh, strong.  Talk to you soon.

@@@ CONNECTION LOST

# messing

Seriously?  You think this is... oh my god, my teeth are, like,
vibrating.  I gotta turn this off.  Just... [[north->n2]],
[[south->s2]], [[east->e2]], or [[west->w2]]?

# n2

I can't believe I... we'll talk about this later, okay?

@@@ CONNECTION LOST

# w2

Right on.  Wait, is it right?  It's totally right.  Right!  I'll
check back later.

@@@ CONNECTION LOST

@@@ CONNECTION LOST

# s2

South.  Which would be... just, yeah, okay.  I'll talk to you later.

@@@ CONNECTION LOST

#stop

Like, anywhere in particular?  Or just... this thing where you're
in my head is driving me crazy, my teeth are like... how about if
I check back in half an hour?  Or if anything interesting happens.
Great, catch you later.  Oh my god.  They're, like, singing.

@@@ CONNECTION LOST

#south

Wow, this thing is, I don't know, powerful.  Feels weird.

@@@ CONNECTION LOST

#west

So... uh... wow, this thing is really getting to me, can't think
straight.  No, I got it, this way.  Yes.  Good.  Talk to you in a bit.

@@@ CONNECTION LOST

#ring

Yeah, right on, collect the whole set.  You're not going to get
jealous, are you?  Sorry, maybe that's... anyway I'm getting ahead
of myself.  I don't even know where to start... okay, let me think.
I mean there's the castle, obviously.  Even if it isn't there...
wait, I forgot to... okay, okay, let's do this: Castle!  [[Yes->castle]]
castle, or [[no->no castle]] castle?

# no castle

Not the castle.  Is it... agh... it doesn't even matter where it
is, I just need to, like, make progress somehow, right?  Look, we're
in the middle of nowhere here, right?  I could head down the [[road]],
I could... uh... [[not]] head down the road?

# road

Okay, great, let's do this.  I'll check back in a bit.

@@@ CONNECTION SUSPENDED/RESUMED; ELAPSED TIME 5390s

Hey, I'm... wow, it's like you're really... wow.  This is intense.
Okay.  I'm at the crossroads!  I could turn [[left]], I could go
[[right]], I could just keep going [[straight]].  You tell me.

#left

Left it is!  Wow.  Okay, talk to you soon.

@@@ CONNECTION LOST

Ugh.  Hold on, let me see if there's anything left in the fridge.
I'll be right back.

@@@ CONNECTION LOST

#castle

Castle it is!  I'll check back in when I get close.

@@@ CONNECTION LOST

#not

So you just want me to stay here?  [[Yes->stay]] or [[no->go]]?

#stay

Fine.  Let me... I'm still kind of hungry actually.  I'll be back
in a minute.
