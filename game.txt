There.  There it is.  Phew.

Can you hear me?  [[Yes->cards]] or [[No->can't hear]].

# can't hear

Well that's not good.  Maybe if I adjust the... hold on....

#{@end()}

#cards

Okay, listen carefully, this is important.  I'm drawing a card
now... okay.  It's face down, I haven't looked at it.  Can you tell
me what card it is?  It's okay if you can't.  [[Yes->card yes]], or
[[no->card no]].

#card no

Thank you for being honest.  It's... the sixteen of trumps.  Once
again, the sixteen of trumps.  Now we both have to try again, I
guess.  Thanks, good luck....

#{@end()}

#card yes

Okay, uh... let's do, like, suits?  Is it, um, [[clubs]], or
[[spades]], or [[hearts]], or [[diamonds]], or [[trumps]].  And

#{@end()}

#trumps

Hold on, I'm just going to write this... trumps, okay.  Is it a...
uh, sorry... [[one through ten->low]], [[eleven through twenty-one->high]],
or the, the [[joker]].

#joker

It is really the joker?  Oh never mind I just looked and it's not...

that, sorry, never mind, sorry!  Long day.  Okay.  Go.

#correct

Okay!  I am going to look, and, it's... wow, pretty good.  Pretty
good.  You got it.  Sixteen.  I guess that means we're good to go!
Are you ready?  Say [[yes]].

#yes

Okay.  Let me just get ready.  I'll be right back.

#{@pause 925}

Sorry that took so long!  I got hungry.  Are you still there?  Say
[[yes->there]].

#there

Okay!  Time to do your job.  What do we go for now?  [[Water->water]],
or [[ring]]?

#water

Right to the point!  I like it.  So, okay, I kinda have a plan already...
should I just [[get started]] with that?  Or is it [[no good]]?

# get started

Perfect.  I'll check back in a bit!

#{@end()}

# no good

Huh, okay.  Well, what do you suggest, then?  Stay [[here]]?  Can
I at least go as far as the [[crossroads]]?

#crossroads

Sounds good!  I'll see you in a bit.

#{@pause 5424}

Hey, are you... wow, you're totally there, I can tell.  Reception
must be good out here or something.  Oh my god, this is trippy.
Sorry, okay.  I'm at the crossroads!  So, uh... [[north]], [[south]],
[[east]], or [[west]]?

#north

Really.  You want me to go back north.  Is there... what the hell.
Should I just go back [[home]], then?  Or did you want me to [[stop]]
along the way?

#home

Okay, fine.  I mean I totally trust you and everything, it's just,
I hope you had a good reason... you're sure you're not messing with
me?  [[Yes->messing]] or [[no->not messing]].

# not messing

All right!  Home it is.  I'm gonna turn this thing off again, it's
really, uh, strong.  Talk to you soon.

#{@end()}

# messing

Seriously?  You think this is... oh my god, my teeth are, like,
vibrating.  I gotta turn this off.  Just... [[north->n2]],
[[south->s2]], [[east->e2]], or [[west->w2]]?

# n2

I can't believe I... we'll talk about this later, okay?

#{@end()}

# w2

Right on.  Wait, is it right?  It's totally right.  Right!  I'll
check back later.

#{@end()}

# e2

Right... no, left.  Yes!  Left.  Good.  I'll check back in a bit.

#{@end()}

# s2

South.  Which would be... just, yeah, okay.  I'll talk to you later.

#{@end()}

#stop

Like, anywhere in particular?  Or just... this thing where you're
in my head is driving me crazy, my teeth are like... how about if
I check back in half an hour?  Or if anything interesting happens.
Great, catch you later.  Oh my god.  They're, like, singing.

#{@end()}

#south

Sounds good!  I'll check back in a bit.

#{@end()}

Wow, this thing is, I don't know, powerful.  Feels weird.

#{@end()}

#west

So... uh... wow, this thing is really getting to me, can't think
straight.  No, I got it, this way.  Yes.  Good.  Talk to you in a bit.

#{@end()}

#ring

Yeah, right on, collect the whole set.  You're not going to get
jealous, are you?  Sorry, maybe that's... anyway I'm getting ahead
of myself.  I don't even know where to start... okay, let me think.
I mean there's the castle, obviously.  Even if it isn't there...
wait, I forgot to... okay, okay, let's do this: Castle!  [[Yes->castle]]
castle, or [[no->no castle]] castle?

# no castle

Not the castle.  Is it... agh... it doesn't even matter where it
is, I just need to, like, make progress somehow, right?  Look, we're
in the middle of nowhere here, right?  I could head down the [[road]],
I could... uh... [[not]] head down the road?

# road

Okay, great, let's do this.  I'll check back in a bit.

#{@pause 5390}

Hey, I'm... wow, it's like you're really... wow.  This is intense.
Okay.  I'm at the crossroads!  I could turn [[left]], I could go
[[right]], I could just keep going [[straight]].  You tell me.

#left

Left it is!  Wow.  Okay, talk to you soon.

#{@end()}

#right

Right you are!  Heh heh... whoa, okay, I'll talk to you soon.

#{@end()}

#straight

Got it.  Yeah, I'm just going to, I'll talk to you soon.

#here

Ugh.  Hold on, I need to eat something.  I'll be right back.

#{@end()}

#castle

Castle it is!  I'll check back in when I get close.

#{@end()}

#not

So you just want me to stay here?  [[Yes->stay]] or [[no->go]]?

#stay

Fine.  Let me... I'm still kind of hungry actually.  I'll be back
in a minute.

#{@end()}

#go

Okay, I guess I'll just go wander aimlessly through the forest,
then!

#{@pause 722}

Hey!  I think I see something.  There's a light.  Campfire, maybe.
I'm going to go [[check it out]], unless you think that's a [[bad
idea]].

# bad idea

Gosh, you're no fun.  All right, I'll let you know if I come across
anything else.

#{@pause 4232}

A presence!  Not alone.  Not alone.  Hope!

Help me!

Disaster!  Stupid, stupid disaster.

Can we communicate?

No change.

This protuberance could be a winding mechanism.  Perhaps

#{@end()}

# check it out

Okay, let me see if I can get closer.

#{@pause 240}

Tall people arguing!  Two at least.  I can't quite hear what they're
saying.  Wow, they seem... agitated.  Hmm.  Maybe I should get
[[closer]]?  Or [[no->not closer]]?

# not closer

All right.

Hold on, I want to see if I can hear if I take this off.

#{@end()}

# closer

#{@pause 133}

"...not what we agreed."

Okay, I

"Listen!  Just listen!"

"Like you listened to me?  I don't have to --"

"Listen!"

wow,

"I don't have to!  It's mine!  It's mine by right!  He told us --"

"No, listen!  There!  Did you hear it?"

Crap.  Crap crap crap.

Maybe I could still... I could [[pretend]] I was just... or just
[[lay low]]....

# lay low

"Who's there?"

"We know you're out there!"

"You cannot deceive us!"

"Yeah, we're not gonna take it anymore!"

"Oh, be quiet."

"You be quiet!"

"This is serious!  Pipe down for once!"

"Make me!"

"Don't tempt me."

"You wouldn't."

"Two birds...."

"Drop it!"

"All heads off."

"Don't do this!"

"Mine alone remain!"

#{@end()}

# pretend

"Who's there?"

"Oh!  It's just, it's just, uh," crap, "oh!  Me.  Heh heh.  I was
just, uh, taking a walk, and," crap.  Crap!  "And I saw your, uh,
campfire!"

Actually, that's not --

"Who are you?"

"Oh!  I'm," do I, [[what]] --

# what

Crap!

"Valeria.  I'm Valeria!  Pleased to meet you?"

Hey, this could --

"Greetings, Valeria!  Please forgive my sister and myself; we can
be very, ah, stupid, at times."

"Oh!  Are you giants?"

Ohmygod, did I just, oh my god, what the crap am I, they're gonna --

"How very perspicacious of you.  Truly -- ah, in fact, my sluggish giant
brain is beginning to develop a thought."

"Uh?"

"Yes!  An idea."

What the hell?

"Why don't you join us by the fire, that we may converse more freely?"

Um.  Um!  [[Do it?]]  [[No?]]

# No?

Seriously, right?

"Yeah, uh... thank you for the kind offer but I really can't stay,
I have to, um.  I should be going."

"But you must help us!  We are so stupid!"

"Stop calling me stupid!"

"Gnot gnow, ssisterr!"

Yow.

"Okay well it was very nice meeting you, take care!"

Oh my goodness.

Oh my goodness.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Wow.

[[Wow.]]

# Wow.

Sorry, didn't mean to do that.

That was exciting, right?  What the hell.  Right?

Hold

#{@end()}

# Do it?

"Uhhhhhh... suuuuuure... just, uh, yeah, here we go, right, whoops,
ha, okay, yes, okay, here we are, here we go."

"Please, make yourself comfortable!  There is no need to stand!  I
can offer you this, ah, this fine flat rock!"

"Oh!  I wouldn't want to, uh...."
