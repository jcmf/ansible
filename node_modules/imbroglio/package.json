  "readme": "# imbroglio\n\na tool for making browser-based interactive fiction\n\n## Is this even a real thing?\n\nIn theory, kinda?  It's starting to get to the point where it might\nbe usable for something, though it's still a far cry from what I\nwould like it to be.\n\nIn practice: Not really, no.  Not yet, anyway.  It's still much\nmuch too difficult to use to justify its palty feature set, and\nthere's no documentation.\n\nWhat's going on is that I signed up to do ShuffleComp: Disc Two and\nI'm scrambling to get my entry done using the bits I've been able\nto slap together so far.\n\n## Wait.  What even is this \"interactive fiction\" of which you speak?\n\nLike, in general?  That's just a fancy name people use for text\nadventure games for your computer, where you read a description of\nwhat is happening and then maybe type stuff or click on stuff and\nread what happens next.  Like Infocom's Zork, back in the 1980s,\nwhen PCs were this new thing and were pretty much incapable of\ndisplaying pictures.\n\nChoose Your Own Adventure books might be another good example from\naround the same era.  Or maybe those totally don't count at all,\ndepending on who you ask!  Like didn't I just say computers?\n\nIt's not just one clear thing, it's like several related fuzzy\nthings overlapping.  Sometimes people argue about it, or write\ndissertations about it, or whatever.  You know how people get\nsometimes.\n\n## But basically it's a 1980s nostalgia thing.\n\nOh, no!  Well I mean maybe, partly?  [People](http://www.intfiction.org/)\nstill make [this type of game](http://ifdb.tads.org/), is the thing.\nSome of them are [really\ngood](http://xyzzyawards.org/awards/historical.php)!  And it's not\njust all, like, rehashing the same aesthetic; it's evolved a lot,\nin several --\n\n## Okay that's nice but what is this imbroglio thing for, specifically?\n\nOh!  It's for making a particular style of game that I happen to\nwant to make right now.  I mean maybe it'll turn out to be a *bit*\nmore general, but I hope it won't get too general for its own good.\n\nSome of the basic ideas are:\n\n* you play a game by going to it in your web browser;\n\n* you read a paragraph or three, followed by some multiple-choice\nstyle options;\n\n* you choose an option, revealing some more text, and so on, until\nyou reach an ending;\n\n* you make choices by clicking on them, or else by typing the letter\nor number that appears before or within the thing you want to choose,\nor possibly even by clicking on or typing in a few words;\n\n* you can always scroll back and review the full transcript of the\ngame so far;\n\n* while scrolling back you can change your mind and rewind the game\nto any given point and retroactively choose something else, changing\nhistory, pretty much just by clicking on it;\n\n* the page URL just ends with all the letters and/or numbers of all\nthe choices you've made, which *completely* determine everything\nelse you see in the game, so you can undo a rewind with the Back\nbutton, or save by bookmarking, or just use your browser history\nto go back to what you had an hour ago, or send someone the URL so\nthey can read the full transcript of your story, or close your\nbrowser and pick up again later without having to do anything\nspecial;\n\n* looks nice -- decent fonts, proper dashes and quotes, enough white\nspace to read by, works fine on tiny phones, maybe some illustrations\nor a soundtrack if you want them -- you know, the basics;\n\n* doesn't need a server or a network connection to play;\n\n* creating a game is almost as easy as playing one: start typing\ntext right there in the browser and immediately see it working,\neven offline, save it to a self-contained `.html` file right on\nyour computer, email or upload or do whatever you want with it.\n\n## And have you done any of those things?\n\nSome, yes, with the most notable exception being the part where\ncreating a game is supposed to be easy -- right now it's basically\nimpossible unless you're extremely determined, and it involves\nmucking around with node command-line tools, rather than typing\ntext into a web browser.  I hope to improve this, of course.\n\n## So, um.  How can I put this gently.  Have you heard of a thing called Twine?\n\n[Sure!](http://twinery.org/)\n\n## So... gah... let me guess: you think Twine is terrible?\n\nNot at all!  Twine is *fantastic*.\n[Have](http://indiegames.com/2013/07/browser_pick_ultra_business_ty.html)\n[you](http://gamasutra.com/view/news/189558/IGF_winner_Hofmeier_pays_it_forward_for_Porpentines_Howling_Dogs.php)\n[seen](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/11/11/boo-the-uncle-who-works-at-nintendo/)\n[what](http://www.depressionquest.com/)\n[people](http://inurashii.xyz/twine-is-bad.html)\n[have](http://auntiepixelante.com/mythics/)\n[done](http://selectadecision.info/)\n[with](http://ohnoproblems.itch.io/sabbat-directors-kvt)\n[it?](http://noncanon.com/HorseMaster.html)  It's really inspiring!\n\n## Then I don't even have to explain why you're an idiot for even wanting to make this new thing that is strikingly similar to that existing established thing, because you already know that, right?\n\nYep!\n\n## Don't you feel bad, though, for making the world a worse place by trying to add yet another similar-but-worse thing instead of contributing to this existing good thing?\n\nNope.\n\n## Come on, man.  Work with me, here.  I'm just trying to understand where you're coming from.  Couldn't you just... what's the... where is the point in... why do you... why are... why?\n\n\\*shrug\\*\n\n## You're really not helping your case here.  Why would anyone even want to use your thing?\n\nBeats me.  People do weird things sometimes.\n\n## Wait so uh whose thing is this and what am I allowed to do with it?\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Jacques Frechet\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject\nto the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR\nANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF\nCONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION\nWITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n",
